# Look at the following function header:
# def my_function(a, b, c):
# Now look at the following call to my_function:
# my_function(3, 2, 1)
# When this call executes, what value will be assigned to a? What value will
# be assigned to b? What value will be assigned to c?

# NOTE: There is no program to write as this is only an analysis of
# the function.

# Exmining the functions should convince you that a will be assined 3
# b will be assigned 2 and c will be assigned 1.

# def my_function(a, b, c):
#     my_function(3, 2, 1)
