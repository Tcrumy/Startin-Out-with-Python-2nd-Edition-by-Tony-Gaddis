# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels 
# down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance = Speed * Time
# A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Write a program that displays
# the following:
# • The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 12 hours

# Create a variable to store the speed in mph
speed = 60

# Create 3 variables to store the distance traveled in 5, 8, and 12 hours respectivly
distance_in_5_hours = speed * 5
distance_in_8_hours = speed * 8
distance_in_12_hours = speed * 12

# Display information to the user
print(distance_in_5_hours, "Miles will be traveled in 5 hours.")
print(distance_in_8_hours, "Miles will be traveled in 8 hours.")
print(distance_in_12_hours, "Miles will be traveled in 12 hours.")
