# Wrote assignment statements that perform the following operations with the
# variable a, b, and c.
# a. Adds 2 to a
# b. Multiplys b times 4 and assigns result to a
# c. Divides a by 3.14 and assigns result to b
# d. Subtracts 8 from b and assigns result to a

# NOTE: The book just calls for the assignment statements to be written, but
# the variables must be initialized with a value in order for the assignemnts
# being called for in the bood to take place.
# I will initialize each varaible to 5

a = 5
b = 5
c = 5

# Algorithm in book starts below this line

# a. Adds 2 to a
a += 2

# b. Multiplys b times 4 and assigns result to a
a = b * 4

# c. Divides a by 3.14 and assigns result to b
b = a/3.14

# d. Subtracts 8 from b and assigns result to a
a = b - 8
