# Write a Python statement that multiplies the variable subtotal by 0.15 and
# assigns the result to the variable total.

# NOTE: the variable subtotal must be initialized with a value. Also, it's not
# good programing practice to use a literal number in programs, so the 0.15 should
# be stored in a named variable. I will call this varaible "percentage"

subtotal = 20000
percentage = 0.15

total = subtotal * percentage
